Site settings -->



This app was created specifically to store your basic site settings like branding (logo, etc), footer (social media links)
In theory, you could do the same thing in any other app and register the model as a setting with:

@register_setting
"Model"


By doing this, your model will appear in the wagtail setting section.

You might want to check your app to see if there are generic settings to include here so it's easier to configure them.
